⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE ⚠️
🚨 ALWAYS RUN DRY-RUN BEFORE SENDING LIVE EMAILS 🚨

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:
1. Create your <user-basefolder>
2. Run: /notifybot/venv/bin/python notifybot.py --base-folder <user-basefolder> --dry-run
3. Review draft emails sent to approvers
4. Only after approval, run live: /notifybot/venv/bin/python notifybot.py --base-folder <user-basefolder>

NEVER skip the dry-run step - it prevents sending emails to wrong recipients!

⚠️ AVOID --force FLAG: Never use --force flag unless absolutely required for automation.
   It bypasses the confirmation prompt, increasing risk of accidental sends!
Overview
NotifyBot is an automated email batch sender that supports two distinct modes of operation:

Single Mode: Send ONE email to MULTIPLE recipients
Multi Mode: Send MULTIPLE personalized emails based on filter conditions

The system includes features like dry-run testing, image embedding, attachments, signatures, filtering, and comprehensive logging.

Quick Start
Basic Usage Examples
bash# 🚨 ALWAYS START WITH DRY-RUN 🚨
/notifybot/venv/bin/python notifybot.py --base-folder <user-basefolder> --dry-run

# After dry-run approval, proceed with live sending (WITH confirmation prompt)
/notifybot/venv/bin/python notifybot.py --base-folder <user-basefolder> --mode single

# Multi mode with dry-run first (MANDATORY)
/notifybot/venv/bin/python notifybot.py --base-folder <user-basefolder> --dry-run
/notifybot/venv/bin/python notifybot.py --base-folder <user-basefolder> --mode multi

# Custom batch settings (dry-run first!)
/notifybot/venv/bin/python notifybot.py --base-folder <user-basefolder> --dry-run
/notifybot/venv/bin/python notifybot.py --base-folder <user-basefolder> --batch-size 100 --delay 10

# ⚠️ AVOID: --force flag (only for automation)
# python notifybot.py --base-folder my-campaign --force  # DANGEROUS!

⚠️ DRY-RUN: YOUR SAFETY NET ⚠️
Dry-run mode is MANDATORY before any live email campaign:

✅ Safe Testing: Sends emails ONLY to approvers (never to actual recipients)
✅ Content Preview: Shows exactly what recipients will receive
✅ Recipient Validation: Displays count of who would receive the email
✅ Error Detection: Catches configuration issues before going live
✅ Approval Workflow: Allows stakeholders to review before sending

NEVER skip dry-run - it's your protection against email disasters!
🚫 --force FLAG WARNING 🚫
The --force flag is DANGEROUS and should be avoided in most cases:

❌ Bypasses Confirmation: No final prompt before sending
❌ Increases Risk: Easy to accidentally send to wrong recipients
❌ No Last Chance: No opportunity to abort if you notice an error
❌ Human Error Prone: Removes the final safety check

⚠️ Only use --force for:

Automated scripts in controlled environments
Scheduled campaigns with thorough pre-testing

✅ Recommended approach:

Always let the system prompt for confirmation
Use the final prompt to double-check everything
Take a moment to verify recipient counts and settings

Directory Structure
Create your <user-basefolder> folder inside /notifybot/basefolder/:

/notifybot/basefolder/<user-basefolder>/
							├── subject.txt         # Email subject line
							├── body.html           # HTML email body
							├── from.txt            # Sender email address
							├── approver.txt        # Approver emails (for dry-run)
							├── mode.txt            # Optional: "single" or "multi"
							├── to.txt              # Recipients (single mode)
							├── cc.txt              # CC recipients (optional)
							├── bcc.txt             # BCC recipients (optional)
							├── filter.txt          # Filter conditions
							├── field.txt           # Field names for substitution (multi mode)
							├── additional_to.txt   # Additional recipients to merge

Required Files
All Modes

subject.txt 	- Email subject line
body.html 		- HTML email content
from.txt 		- Sender email address
approver.txt 	- Email addresses for dry-run testing


Single Mode Additional Requirements

to.txt 											- Direct recipient list
filter.txt + /notifybot/inventory/inventory.csv - Filtered recipients
additional_to.txt 								- Additional recipients
cc.txt 											- CC recipients
bcc.txt 										- BCC recipients

Multi Mode Additional Requirements

filter.txt 										- Filter conditions (required)
/notifybot/inventory/inventory.csv 				- Master database (required)
field.txt 										- Field names for personalization (optional)



to.txt / cc.txt / bcc.txt / additional_to.txt  - format

user1@company.com;user2@company.com
user3@company.com
user4@company.com;user5@company.com;user6@company.com


❌ NEVER DO THIS:

Skip dry-run testing
Send live emails without approval
Make changes without re-testing
Ignore dry-run recipient counts
Use --force flag for manual operations
Bypass confirmation prompts unnecessarily

✅ ALWAYS DO THIS:

Start every campaign with dry-run
Get approver sign-off on drafts
Verify recipient counts match expectations
Test all personalization and formatting
Allow system to prompt for final confirmation
Take time to review before confirming send


NotifyBot Recipient Priority Guide
🚨 DRY-RUN MODE (All Modes)
Highest Priority: Safety First
In dry-run mode, ALL recipients are replaced with approvers regardless of mode:

✅ ONLY sends to: approver.txt recipients
❌ NEVER sends to: Any actual recipients (TO, CC, BCC)
📧 Subject prefix: "DRAFT - " (auto-added)
📊 Shows counts: Original recipient numbers for review
⚠️ Purpose: Safe testing and approval workflow

SINGLE MODE - Live Sending
Sends ONE email to MULTIPLE recipients
TO Recipients Priority (Choose ONE source):

Priority 1: to.txt (if exists)

Uses existing to.txt directly
➕ Merges with: additional_to.txt (if exists)
📝 Note: No overwriting of existing to.txt


Priority 2: Filter Logic (if to.txt doesn't exist)

Uses filter.txt + /notifybot/inventory/inventory.csv
➕ Merges with: additional_to.txt (if exists)
💾 Creates: to.txt with merged results for future use


Priority 3: additional_to.txt only (if nothing else available)

Uses only additional_to.txt
💾 Creates: to.txt from additional_to.txt



CC/BCC Recipients:

CC: cc.txt (included in ALL batches)
BCC: bcc.txt (included in ALL batches)
⚠️ Important: CC/BCC recipients receive multiple copies if batching is used

Batching Behavior:

TO recipients split into batches (default: 500)
CC/BCC included in every batch (causing duplicates)
Delay between batches (default: 5 seconds)


🎯 MULTI MODE - Live Sending
Sends MULTIPLE personalized emails (one per filter condition)
Required Files:

filter.txt (required) - Each line = one separate email
/notifybot/inventory/inventory.csv (required)
field.txt (optional) - For personalization placeholders

Email Generation:

One email per line in filter.txt
Each email uses filter conditions to select recipients from inventory
Personalization via {field_name} placeholders in subject/body

Recipients Per Email:

TO: Recipients matching that specific filter condition
CC: cc.txt recipients (added to EVERY individual email)
BCC: bcc.txt recipients (added to EVERY individual email)

CC/BCC Multiplication:

If you have 5 filter lines and 3 CC recipients
CC recipients get 5 separate emails (one per filter)
Same applies to BCC recipients

🔄 Recipient Processing Flow
Single Mode Flow:
1. Check for to.txt → Use directly
2. If no to.txt → Apply filter.txt logic → Create to.txt
3. Merge with additional_to.txt (if exists)
4. Add CC/BCC to every batch
5. Send in batches with delays


Multi Mode Flow:
1. Read each line from filter.txt
2. For each line:
   - Apply filter to inventory.csv
   - Generate personalized content
   - Add CC/BCC recipients
   - Send individual email
3. Delay between each email

⚠️ Important Warnings
CC/BCC Duplication:

Single Mode: CC/BCC get multiple emails if batching occurs
Multi Mode: CC/BCC get separate emails for each filter condition
Solution: Consider this when planning campaigns

File Priority Conflicts:

If both to.txt and filter.txt exist in single mode, to.txt wins
Delete to.txt to force fresh filter results
Dry-run shows warning about existing to.txt

Recipient Validation:

All email addresses validated before sending
Invalid emails logged and skipped
Duplicates automatically removed (case-insensitive)


📊 Summary Table
Mode				TO Source Priority				CC/BCC Behavior		Batching	Duplication Risk	
Dry-Run				approver.txt only				None (disabled)		No			None
Single Live			to.txt → filter → additional	Every batch			Yes			CC/BCC per batch
Multi Live			Per filter condition			Every email			No			CC/BCC per email
